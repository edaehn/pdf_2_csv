# pdf_2_csv
Extracting a table from the provided PDF file into CSV

This script demonstrates two methods of converting a table 
extracted from the Scrape.pdf file into a CSV file.
For creating these methods, we exploit PyPDF2 and tabula.
We will see which method is the best by measuring their execution time.
Finally, with the help of Pandas DataFrame, we check if both CSV outputs do match.
